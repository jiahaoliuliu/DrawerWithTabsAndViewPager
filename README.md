TabSwipe
========

This is a project with Drawer(left) + tab host + view pager. The tabs and the pagers are linked, so if you clicks on any tab, the corresponding page will be shown. In the same way, if you swipe any viewpager, the corresponding tab will be pointed.

This project has been deprecated because I have created a gradle version of it, but it does not means that it does not work.

Here is the link to the gradle version:

Note you must link the android sherlock actionbar to make it works:
